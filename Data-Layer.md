# Data Layer (`wickra-data`)

`wickra-data` is a separate crate that feeds candles into Wickra's indicators.
It is not part of `wickra-core` — depend on it explicitly:

```toml
[dependencies]
wickra = "0.1"
wickra-data = "0.1"
```

It provides four pieces:

- a streaming OHLCV **CSV reader**,
- a **tick-to-candle aggregator**,
- a **candle resampler** for multi-timeframe analysis,
- an optional **Binance Spot WebSocket** kline feed (feature `live-binance`).

## CSV reader

`CandleReader` streams OHLCV rows out of a CSV file into validated `Candle`
values.

```rust
use wickra_data::csv::CandleReader;

let mut reader = CandleReader::open("ohlcv.csv")?;
let candles = reader.read_all()?;          // Vec<Candle>

// Or stream row by row without buffering the whole file:
let mut reader = CandleReader::open("ohlcv.csv")?;
for candle in reader.candles() {
    let candle = candle?;
    // feed `candle` into an indicator...
}
```

The reader is defensive about real-world files:

- The first line **must** be a header naming the columns
  `timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume`. A missing column, or a file with no
  header at all, is rejected with a clear `Error::Malformed` instead of
  silently consuming the first data row.
- A leading UTF-8 byte-order mark (Excel exports one) is stripped.
- Whitespace around values is trimmed.
- Each row is validated through `Candle::new`, so an inconsistent OHLC row
  (e.g. `high < low`) surfaces as an error.

## Tick aggregator

`TickAggregator` rolls a stream of trade `Tick`s up into `Candle`s of an
arbitrary timeframe. The timeframe's bucket size is in the same unit as the
tick timestamps (milliseconds for Binance, seconds for daily bars, …).
Build a `Timeframe` with `Timeframe::new` (a raw bucket size), the
`millis` / `seconds` / `one_minute_ms` shortcuts, or the `minutes` / `hours` /
`days` constructors — each of the last three builds on **seconds**, so
`Timeframe::minutes(5)` is a 300-second bucket.

```rust
use wickra_data::aggregator::{TickAggregator, Timeframe};
use wickra_core::Tick;

let mut agg = TickAggregator::new(Timeframe::one_minute_ms());

let trade_feed: Vec<Tick> = Vec::new(); // your live trade-tick feed
for tick in trade_feed {
    // push returns every candle that closed because of this tick —
    // empty while the bar grows, one candle when a bar boundary is crossed.
    for closed in agg.push(tick)? {
        // feed `closed` into an indicator...
    }
}

// Capture the final, still-open bar at the end of the stream.
if let Some(last) = agg.flush()? {
    // ...
}
```

Out-of-order ticks — across or within a bucket — are rejected with
`Error::Malformed` rather than silently corrupting a bar.

### Gap filling

By default a tick that jumps across one or more empty buckets simply opens
the next non-empty bar, leaving a time hole in the output. Enable
`with_gap_fill` to emit a flat placeholder candle
(`open == high == low == close`, `volume == 0`) for every skipped bucket, so
downstream indicators see an unbroken, evenly spaced series:

```rust
use wickra_data::aggregator::{TickAggregator, Timeframe};
let mut agg = TickAggregator::new(Timeframe::one_minute_ms()).with_gap_fill(true);
```

## Resampler

`Resampler` rolls an existing candle stream up to a coarser timeframe — for
example 1-minute bars into 5-minute bars, without touching the original tick
stream.

```rust
use wickra_data::aggregator::Timeframe;
use wickra_data::resample::{resample_all, Resampler};

// `one_min_candles` is your fallible 1-minute source (e.g. a CSV reader),
// yielding `Result<Candle>` items.
let one_min_candles: Vec<wickra_data::Result<wickra::Candle>> = Vec::new();

// One-shot over an iterator:
let five_min = resample_all(Timeframe::millis(5 * 60_000)?, one_min_candles)?;

// Or incrementally:
let mut r = Resampler::new(Timeframe::millis(60 * 60_000)?); // 1-hour bars
let one_min_candles: Vec<wickra_data::Result<wickra::Candle>> = Vec::new();
for candle in one_min_candles {
    if let Some(closed) = r.push(candle?)? {
        // a coarser bar just closed
    }
}
let last = r.flush()?;
```

The output timeframe's bucket must be a multiple of the input timeframe's
bucket — picking sensible aggregations (1m → 5m → 1h) is the caller's
responsibility. A candle that arrives in a bucket earlier than the open bar
is rejected as out of order.

## Binance live feed

With the `live-binance` feature enabled, `BinanceKlineStream` connects to the
Binance Spot WebSocket and yields closed klines as candles.

```toml
wickra-data = { version = "0.2", features = ["live-binance"] }
```

```rust
use wickra::{Indicator, Rsi};
use wickra_data::live::binance::{BinanceKlineStream, Interval};

async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut stream =
        BinanceKlineStream::connect(&["BTCUSDT".into()], Interval::OneMinute).await?;
    let mut rsi = Rsi::new(14)?;

    while let Some(event) = stream.next_event().await? {
        if event.is_closed {
            if let Some(v) = rsi.update(event.candle.close) {
                println!("RSI = {v:.2}");
            }
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

The stream is resilient: it reconnects with exponential backoff after a
dropped connection, skips non-kline frames (subscription acks, heartbeats),
applies a read timeout and message-size limits, and tracks a closed flag so a
deliberately closed stream is not reused.

### Custom endpoint and timing (`BinanceConfig`)

Since `wickra-data@0.2.5`, the connector accepts a `BinanceConfig` so you can
point it at a different endpoint (Binance Testnet is the common case) or
tune the read-timeout / reconnect timings to suit your environment:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use wickra_data::live::binance::{BinanceConfig, BinanceKlineStream, Interval};

async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let cfg = BinanceConfig {
        base_url: "wss://testnet.binance.vision".to_string(),
        read_timeout: Duration::from_secs(60),
        ..BinanceConfig::default()
    };

    let _stream = BinanceKlineStream::connect_with_config(
        &["BTCUSDT".into()],
        Interval::OneMinute,
        cfg,
    )
    .await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

`BinanceConfig` exposes the base URL (no path — the combined-stream path is
appended internally), the read timeout, the initial / capped reconnect
backoff, the maximum reconnect attempts, and the inbound message / frame
size caps. `connect()` is now a thin wrapper around
`connect_with_config(symbols, interval, BinanceConfig::default())`, so the
defaults still target the public Binance Spot endpoint and the previous
production timings — no migration is needed for existing callers.

A runnable example lives at `examples/rust/src/bin/live_binance.rs`:

```bash
cargo run -p wickra-examples --bin live_binance
```

## Example datasets

The repository ships seven ready-to-use OHLCV datasets under
`examples/data/`, one per timeframe, holding real Binance **BTCUSDT** spot
candles in the standard `timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume` layout the
`CandleReader` reads. The timestamp is each candle's open time in milliseconds.

| File | Timeframe | Rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `btcusdt-1m.csv` | 1 minute | 50 000 |
| `btcusdt-5m.csv` | 5 minutes | 10 000 |
| `btcusdt-15m.csv` | 15 minutes | 10 000 |
| `btcusdt-1h.csv` | 1 hour | 10 000 |
| `btcusdt-12h.csv` | 12 hours | 5 000 |
| `btcusdt-1d.csv` | 1 day | full history |
| `btcusdt-1month.csv` | 1 month | full history |

The monthly file is named `btcusdt-1month.csv` rather than `btcusdt-1M.csv` so
it does not collide with `btcusdt-1m.csv` on case-insensitive filesystems. The
indicator benchmarks and the `example_data` integration test both run against
these files.

Regenerate them with the latest market history — this downloads from the
Binance REST API and needs the system `curl` (shipped with Windows 10+, macOS
and Linux):

```bash
cargo run -p wickra-examples --bin fetch_btcusdt
```
