# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about Wickra. If yours is not here, check the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra/issues) or open a new
issue.

## Will batch and streaming produce the same result?

Yes — bit-identical, by construction. `batch(prices)` is a one-line wrapper
that calls `update(p)` for every `p` in the input. The same unit test —
`batch_equals_streaming` — pins this for every indicator. See
[Streaming vs Batch](Streaming-vs-Batch) for the full contract.

## What does `warmup_period()` mean?

It's the number of inputs an indicator needs before it emits its first
non-`None` value. For RSI(14) that's 15 (14 diffs plus the seed); for
SMA(20) it's 20; for MACD(12, 26, 9) it's 34 (`slow + signal − 1`). After
warmup the indicator never goes back to `None`. The complete table lives
at [Warmup Periods](Warmup-Periods).

## Why am I getting `None` / `NaN` for the first N values?

That's the warmup. Use `is_ready()` (or the corresponding `isReady()` in
Node, `is_ready()` in Python) to gate your code on "do I have a real
value yet?" rather than counting inputs yourself:

```python
import wickra as ta
rsi = ta.RSI(14)
for price in feed:
    rsi.update(price)
    if rsi.is_ready():
        ...
```

## Which indicator should I use for X?

A short cheat-sheet (full version at the bottom of
[Indicators Overview](Indicators-Overview)):

- **trend direction** → MA family (`SMA`, `EMA`, `HMA`, `T3`, `KAMA`)
- **trend strength** → `ADX`, `ChoppinessIndex`, `VerticalHorizontalFilter`
- **overbought / oversold** → `RSI`, `Stochastic`, `Williams %R`, `MFI`
- **volatility** → `ATR`, `TrueRange`, `ChaikinVolatility`, `StdDev`
- **breakout level** → `Donchian`, `BollingerBands`
- **trailing stop** → `PSAR`, `SuperTrend`, `ChandelierExit`,
  `AtrTrailingStop`
- **volume confirmation** → `OBV`, `ChaikinMoneyFlow`, `VWAP`

## Is a single indicator instance thread-safe?

No. `update` mutates state, so a single instance must not be shared across
threads. Each thread should own its own indicator. For multi-asset
parallelism, the Rust crate provides `BatchExt::batch_parallel`, which
fans out over many series each with its own fresh instance behind the
default `parallel` feature (rayon). Node's `worker_threads` gives the
same shape from JavaScript — see `examples/node/parallel_assets.js`.

## Does Wickra need a system compiler to install?

No. Every published wheel (PyPI), npm package, and crate ships pre-built
artefacts. `pip install wickra` and `npm install wickra` are
no-prerequisite installs on Linux, macOS, and Windows x64 / arm64. The
only time you need a toolchain is when you are building Wickra from
source.

## How do I handle non-finite inputs (NaN / Inf)?

The scalar indicators (`SMA`, `EMA`, `WMA`, `RSI`, `ROC`, …) return the
most recent valid value when fed a non-finite input, leaving their state
untouched. That lets a missing price in your feed pass through without
poisoning the rest of the series. `ATR` and the volume-aware indicators
reject non-finite volume at the `Candle::new` boundary, so an aggregator
that overflows surfaces an error instead of producing a corrupted candle
(see [Data Layer](Data-Layer)).

## How fast is Wickra?

The streaming path is O(1) per `update` — the per-tick cost does not grow
with how much history you have already seen. The README has a benchmark
table comparing Wickra against `finta` and `talipp`; the gap is roughly
10–30× on batch workloads and ~17× per tick on a streaming RSI seeded
with 2 000 historical bars.

## How do I add a custom indicator?

Implement the `Indicator` trait in
`crates/wickra-core/src/indicators/<your_name>.rs`, wire it through the
bindings, and add reference-value plus `batch == streaming` equivalence
tests. The complete how-to and the project's standards are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where do I get historical OHLCV data to test with?

The repo ships seven real BTCUSDT datasets at
`examples/data/btcusdt-{1m,5m,15m,1h,12h,1d,1month}.csv` (50 000 / 10 000 /
10 000 / 10 000 / 5 000 / 3 200 / 105 candles respectively). Refresh them
with the latest market history via
`cargo run -p wickra-examples --bin fetch_btcusdt`. See
[Data Layer](Data-Layer) for the full story.

## How is Wickra different from TA-Lib / pandas-ta / talipp?

- TA-Lib and pandas-ta are batch-only — every new tick triggers a full
  recomputation. Wickra updates in O(1). The numerical results are the
  same; the speed gap shows up in live trading and large backtests.
- talipp is streaming-first like Wickra but Python-only and slower per
  update.
- `finta` is batch-only and pure-Python.
- `ta-lib-python` and TA-Lib both require C build tooling on Windows;
  Wickra ships pre-built native wheels.
